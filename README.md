# **Housing Prices Prediction**

## **🌟 Overview**
Housing Prices Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting housing prices in California. It involves comparing various machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) to determine the most effective algorithm for estimating house prices. The project explores various data analysis techniques, such as feature scaling, data preprocessing, and model evaluation using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to assess model performance.

## **❓ Why This Project?**
The primary goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict housing prices using various attributes such as median income, population density, and location. By comparing different models, the project aims to identify which algorithm yields the most accurate results, helping to understand how well each model can predict housing prices and contributing to the field of real estate analytics.

## **🔑 Key Features & Learnings**
* Multiple Model Comparison: The project compares three models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, transforming categorical attributes, and scaling numerical features for optimal model performance.
* Overfitting & Underfitting: The project discusses these concepts and how they affect model accuracy, using techniques like K-fold cross-validation to mitigate them.
* Model Evaluation: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and cross-validation are used to measure model performance.
